TravelDream
===========

Webapp that allows user to buy package that include flight, hotel and escursion.
Users can be divided in 3 categories:
-not registered;
-registered;
-employee;
  
  Who belongs to the first group can only see the packages purposed, the gift list of a friend of him and 
a package to which he has been invited.
  The second kind of people can personalize the default package, changeing for example the hotel or excursions and then 
buy it, add components (flight, hotel, excursions) to his giftlist, send giftlist/package-invite to other person.
  Employees can create from zero new components and, then, new package based on components, can invalidate components and
packages which contains them.


This project has been developed during the course of "Software Engineering 2" with my two classmate Enrico and Niccol√≤.
